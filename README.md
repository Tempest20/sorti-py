# sorti-py

--------------------------

Sorti-Py is a CLI tool that sorts the current folder you're in.

It sorts all files into their respective folders, for example, it takes all .pdf files in your current directory, and puts them in a pdf folder.
It works for all extensions and will make organizing messy folders a lot easier.

**USAGE**

- type "sortipy"
