# sorti-py, written in Python


Sorti-Py is a CLI tool that sorts the current folder you're in.

It sorts all files into their respective folders, for example, it takes all .pdf files in your current directory, and puts them in a pdf folder.
It works for all extensions and will make organizing messy folders a lot easier.

# Usage
- cd into the directory you wish sorted
- type "sortipy"
- you can use the -h flag to see optional arguments



# Installation
- clone this repository
- cd into sorti-py
- type "sudo mv sortipy /usr/bin"
- type "sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/sortipy"


**NOTE:** The reason you need sudo privileges is to move sortipy to $PATH, so you can use it anywhere without needing to specify the location of the script.
